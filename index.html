                    <h2>A Little About Johnny Cruz</h2>
                    <p>If you're reading this, I just want to say thank you for stopping by. My names Johnny, and I'm a full stack javascript(MERN) developer, with a a passion for Design. I recently graduated from Alchemy Code Lab in April of 2019 and was immediately chosen to be one of the few students to help out with building full stack React applications for real clients. These past 3 montsh have flown by and I've learned so much from being involved with a small group of developers. About a year ago I was working on some graphic design projects as a
                        freelancer and I realized that if I ever wanted to take my digital content to the next level I
                        was going to have to learn to code in order to create web pages. I heard about online coding
                        programs but I wanted something that was personable. During my research, I came across Alchemy
                        Code lab which is a full stack Javasript program based out of Portland, OR. Taking this course
                        was the best decision I made all of 2018. In the span of 6 months I spent over 1000 hours learning 
                        Everything about JS. One thing I've realized is that the learning never stops and I will forever
                        be a student. I enjoy learning new technologies and overall just leveling up my current skills.
                        My goal is to create appealing and intuitive front end applications for the world to use.
                        Besides trying to be tech savvy I enjoy playing video games(currently stuck on Fortnite),
                        jamming out to music(currently learning to play guitar) and playing basketball(currently trying
                        to play more like Dame Lillard). I'm glad to answer any of your tech questions, so please, ask
                        away!

                    <h2 class="blogTitle">REACT-What's the hype?</h2>
                    <p class="notes">
                        Before I learned about react I was anxious to know how to use it since so many people hyped it
                        up. For some reason, I thought that because people were so excited to talk about react, it
                        correlated to being an easy framework to learn. However, it was not as easy as I thought it
                        would be. However, don’t let this discourage you from learning React since we all pick up new
                        subjects at a different pace. Plus, as long as you’re comfortable with Js then there’s no reason
                        for anyone to not be able to pick up this framework. <br />

                        One word to describe the process of React would be abstract. When I started using React I came
                        to find out that even though it is still Javascript its a completely different way of creating
                        web pages, letting you write up all your HTML and CSS within JS. What was most confusing to me
                        was the idea of passing state to props. Once I figured out the difference between state, props
                        and static props, as well as extracting each component to its own file, then it all clicked.
                        What I came to realize is that components are simply just functions. Nav bars, footers, buttons
                        get extracted to their own components/file and even though a Nav might not be functional we
                        still implement it in its own component which is a representational function that renders
                        itself. In other words, we put the Nav in its own functions which takes props aka parameters
                        which are needed to build the Nav. We can think of props such as attributes. In order to build a
                        common nav bar we need links such as home, blog, about. These 3 could be considered props which
                        can be used to build the nav bar. The fact that each component needs to be extracted to its own
                        file may sound like a lot of work at first but the cool thing about this is that each component
                        can easily be reused throughout your app by simply importing your component wherever you want to
                        use it. <br />

                        But why even learn React other than it being a popular framework used by several companies? If
                        you’re already comfortable with JS and want to make yourself more marketable when looking for a
                        job, then React definitely won't hurt to have under your belt. What makes React so unique is
                        that it saves a lot of loading time by incorporating a virtual dom (don't worry, even though
                        this is a feature of React there's not much to know about the virtual dom, besides reaping its
                        benefits) Anyways, the virtual dom only renders state(elements)that have been changed. For
                        example, if your app makes an API call the page needs to reload with that new data. Without
                        React all elements including images, Headers etc would need to reload, but with React only that
                        new API element reloads. This is especially noticeable with huge apps, impacting both the User
                        experience and overall performance on your app.
                        If you are looking into learning react here's some common terminology/tools you’ll want to get
                        to know. Besides youtube and Udemy I would recommend Wes <a

                        <strong>React For Web-</strong> React's version of making web applications<br />
                        <strong>React Native-</strong> React's version of making mobile applications<br />
                        <strong>State-</strong> Data or elements that can change in the dom e.g user input API calls,
                        images.<br />
                        <strong>Props</strong> These can be considered as attributes when creating component. <br />
                        <strong>Prop Types-</strong>Whenever components take in any prop, we can declare what kind of
                        element we expecting to pass through from our Presentational Component. These can be functions,
                        array, objects etc. Prop types are optional but are highly recommended to help other developers
                        know what kind of elements can be passed through and will help prevent bugs. <br />
                        <strong>Presentational Components-</strong> Components that are pertaining to how something is
                        going to look. can also be considered as dummy components since they don't directly deal with
                        state.<br />
                        <strong>container Components-</strong> Components that pertain to how things work. They deal
                        directly with state and end up rendering the final outcome of the component. <br />
                        <strong>Pure Components-</strong> Goes along with Presentational component, only renders state
                        that was updated <br />
                        <strong>Class Components-</strong> Also goes along with Presentational component, renders all
                        state within the component<br />
                        <strong>React Router-</strong> A simple API which helps hook up our routes between different
                        pages/components. <br />
                        <strong>Babel-</strong> React is dependent on babel in order for us to be able to write HTML and
                        CSS in Javascript. <br />

                    <h2 class="blogTitle">Node, A JS Blessing.</h2>
                    <p class="notes">Before I started working with Node I was so Oblivious to the backend and how
                        powerful it was. I didn't Even know what An API was exactly. I knew it stood for an Application
                        Processing Interface, but I wasn't able to dive deep into the topic. Once I created my first
                        backend Application I was awed by node and its magic. Node is a runtime environment which easily
                        gets confused with a framework or library. Node Allows us Javascript developers to write backend
                        code with Javascript. Before Node, Javascript was only limited to front end development, making
                        Node a pretty big deal for several reasons. First off all, we can create a full stack
                        application using only one language, so theres no need to take extra time to learn PHP, Python
                        or Java. All you need to do is npm i Node with a couple other packages and you're on your way!
                        Ok, there's a bit of a learning curve, but since you already know Javascript you will at least
                        be familiar with some of the syntax. If you're new to node or the backend in general, here are
                        some terms you'll come across in the backend world. <br />

                        <strong>HTTP</strong>-Short for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol. We can create/update data on the
                        client side through CRUD Methods including, GET, PUT, POST, DELETE and PATCH. <br />
                        <strong>Express</strong>-A popular Node JS framework which allows us to create a server and and
                        set up our CRUD methods. <a class="underline"
                            href="https://scotch.io/bar-talk/10-node-frameworks-to-use-in-2019">Here</a> are some
                        similar frameworks with different features.<br />
                        <strong><a class="underline" href="https://www.npmjs.com/">Node Package
                                Manager(NPM)</a></strong>-An ecosystem full of scripts that developers can share. If
                        you're trying to code a common functionality for an app which you've see across different
                        applications, chances are you can find it though the <a class="underline"
                            href="https://www.npmjs.com/">NPM website</a>.<br />
                        <strong>Module.exports</strong>-Allows us to organize our functions and easily inject them
                        between other files.<br />
                        <strong>Middleware</strong>-Functions that run in between calls made outside of our application.
                        Middleware can be used to debugging and checking for Connection errors. For example If we are
                        trying to connect to our database we can throw an error function that logs that theres a problem
                        with with connecting.

                    <h2 class="blogTitle">Light Intro to Backend Development</h2>
                    <p class="notes">Long story short Backend Development is working with databases and dealing with
                        sending and receiving data(http requests), but if your want a bit more info please continue
                        reading...</br>
                        Before this year, I knew that when it came to web development, there are 3 types of developers:
                        backend developers, front end developers and fullstack developers. While front end devs focus on
                        making sites look pretty and everything HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Backend devs deal with JS
                        algorithms as well as working with servers, including retrieving users names passwords and
                        information that the website handles. This leads to us to the topic of HTTP Methods aka CRUD,
                        which is short for 'create', read, update and delete. okay... but how is this used? Let's use
                        Instagram for example since that's what us millennials are into. When we open up the app and go
                        to the home page to look at everyone's post we tapping into Instagram's database and asking it
                        to <strong>GET</strong> data for us, which means that the developers have to make a function
                        that lists all of the new posts that our friends have posted when we click the home icon. Have
                        you ever thought about what kind of method is used to 'upload' a picture? Well, when uploading
                        or creating any kind of content for the world to see we use a <stong>POST</stong> method to send
                        new information to the server. What about to delete? well, you guessed it <strong>
                            DELETE</strong>. Another commonly used method would be <strong>PATCH</strong>, or
                        <strong>PUT</strong> which wouldn't be used for a picture but for a comment. For example, you
                        might have made typo; sometimes we might spell a word so wrong on our smartphone that
                        autocorrect isn't even able to correct it. If you're considering getting started with Backend
                        development and be able to dabble with these CRUD methods You're going to have to look into <a

                        is the javascript framework that lets us do backend development. Once you get done with that

                    <p class="notes">So you want to learn about code huh? If you enjoy not having an idea about what
                        you’re doing and your pretty decent at maneuvering your way through google to find your answers,
                        then you chose the right field. If you have no Idea what type of coding you want to dive into,
                        figure out what technology you want to learn...Do you want to make video games for Nintendo or
                        Playstation? Then you would want to look into <span>c++, c#</span> and <span>java</span>. Want
                        to learn about data management, working with tables and using that information in a unique way
                        such as portraying stats? <span>SQL or Python<span> are where its at. If you’re like me and
                                you're looking into designing websites and web applications then you’re going to start
                                with html/css, then move onto <span>javascrtipt<span>, which makes websites more robust

                                                awesome about Udemy is that they provide full on courses and have sales
                                                all the time where the course turns out to be less than $15.00. Theres a

                    <p class="notes"> Toughest part about learning on your own is discipline and holding yourself
                        accountable. No one’s going to tell you what you have to do as far as staying consistent so it’s
                        easier to just tell yourself that you’ll get to it eventually, but Soon enough eventually
                        becomes never. If this is your issue check to see if theirs an in person bootcamp in your city.
                        Being around coders will help you make connections and push you further. Personally I don't
                        think I would have learned as much online because my lack of discipline, but thats just me,
                        chances are you're a lot more self motiated than me. Don’t get discouraged to join an online
                        bootcamp, the right one will have a course that gets you to build projects that lead into a
                        plehora amount of knowledge. BUT PLEASE DO YOUR RESEARCH because not all of them are going to
                        give you the tools and knowledge to prep you for a job. If I never joined a bootcamp I would
                        have never considered learning github, SQL, the command line and practicing code on sites like
                        <a href="https://www.codewars.com/">Codewars</a> and <a
                            href="https://codesignal.com/">Codesignal.</a> Long story short DO YOUR RESEARCH, commit and
                        code everyday!</p>

                    <p class="notes">Never did I think I would be a podcast listener, but I needed a way to keep up
                        this fast paced industry where the learning never stops and I needed a way to divulge myslef with code talk. listening to podcasts over my gangster rap music has made
                        me more fluent when it comes to talking code as well as given me ideas for my code. There has
                        been several times where I got done learning a new subject and which I was still hazy on, but then I ran into a podcast on that same subject which answered a
                        my questions. There was one time that I was listening to a coding podcast and I
                        needed help with an ajax call. The TA went off into talking about promises which I was able to
                        quickly catch on because the podcast (syntax) had mentioned the promise method. Here are a list of podcasts I listen to off of Spotify:
